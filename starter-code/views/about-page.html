      <h1>Some really awesome things you need to know about me</h1>
      <p>
        I'm leaving in Paris, near Pigalle & I really love seeing all the
        ligthnings shops when I got my night walk. <br />Mom say I'm her baby
        but it's so wrong, I am as mature as she is.<br />My diet is croquettes
        everyday, but when I'm a good boy she gives me chicken nuggets, steak
        and paper toilets (I love it!).
